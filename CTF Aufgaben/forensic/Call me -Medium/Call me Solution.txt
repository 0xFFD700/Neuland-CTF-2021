An AB file is a backup of some or all of the data stored on a user's Android device. We can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) with the command 
```java -jar abp.jar unpack backup.ab backup.zip```
to extract the files.

The challenge description gives us the hint that the flag was shared with a friend. Let's take a look at the SMS App under **backup/apps/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db**. Here we can find a database containing all SMS Communication.
A simple 
```strings mmssms.db```
reveals all the messages including
```The password is "6e 6c 61 6e 64 7b 6d 30 38 31 31 33 70 68 30 6e 33 7d 0a" I have formatted it in hex so no one can search for it!```

The flag is ```nland{m08113ph0n3}```
