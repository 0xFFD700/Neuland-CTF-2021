Some dots seem to have a thinner rim and look like braille. If we translate them, it spells **agruizlke**. After taking a closer look at the picture itself, it seems to contain something. We can try to extract it with [Steghide](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/) ```steghide extract -sf blindspot.jpg``` . The extracted text file contains the flag.
