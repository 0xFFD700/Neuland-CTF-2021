For the first part of the flag we need to take a look at the linked [Instagram of Simon Etsukos](https://www.instagram.com/simon.etsuko/) which includes a picture of his cat titled *Bodo*. 

The second part is hidden in the metadata of the Website. If we inspect the HTML code, we can find 
```<meta name="author" content="*Ada* Lovelace" />```.

For the last piece of the puzzle, we have to call the reverenced phone number, which has a voicemail message telling us that the employee on call is called Mr *Nagel*.

The flag is ```nland{bodo_nagel_ada}```.
